-- Basic Structure of a CSS Stylesheet

Every CSS stylesheet follows a basic structure composed of various rules and selectors. Here is a simple example:

/* This is a comment in CSS */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
Let's break down this structure:

-- Comments

/* This is a comment in CSS */
Comments in CSS are enclosed within /* and */, providing a way to add notes or explanations within your stylesheet.

-- Selectors and Declarations

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
In CSS, selectors target HTML elements, while declarations define the style properties applied to those elements. In this example, the body selector targets the <body> element, and the declarations within the curly braces ({}) specify the styling rules for the body, such as font-family and background-color.

-- Rule Sets

A combination of selectors and declarations forms a rule set. Each rule set defines how a specific element or group of elements should be styled.

-- Common CSS Properties

CSS offers a wide range of properties to style elements. Here are some commonly used properties:

Font Properties
font-family: Specifies the font family for text.
font-size: Sets the size of the font.
font-weight: Specifies the boldness of the font.
Color Properties
color: Sets the text color.
background-color: Sets the background color of an element.
Text Properties
text-align: Aligns text within an element.
line-height: Sets the height of a line of text.
text-decoration: Adds decoration to text, such as underline or strikethrough.
Box Properties
margin: Sets the margin space around an element.
padding: Sets the padding space inside an element's border.
border: Sets the border properties of an element.
Cascading and Specificity

CSS follows the cascading principle, meaning that styles are applied in a hierarchical manner and can be overridden by more specific rules. Understanding specificity is crucial for effectively styling elements and resolving conflicts between styles.

-- External Stylesheets

CSS can be applied externally to HTML documents by linking a stylesheet using the <link> element in the HTML <head> section:

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
This separates the content and presentation layers, making it easier to maintain and update the styles across multiple web pages.
